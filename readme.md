# less-demo

LESS demo is a web presentation deck touching on a very high level introduction
to CSS preprocessors (LESS and SASS). Samples in this presentation are written in __LESS__.

This presentation is written purely in __web technologies__ (just HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript!),
and makes use of LESS CSS for presentation styles.

Animation and positioning styles are dynamically provided by the fantastic
[impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/) framework by [Bartek Szopka](https://github.com/bartaz).

Feel free to clone / fork this repository for your own reference / study!

* __SASS__ http://sass-lang.com


## Using this presentation

Viewing the code on this presentation is available to everyone.
Just browse through the code structure in this repository, no problem!

A better way to study it though is to actually run this presentation on your machine.
Check out how everything comes together and works.


### Prerequisites

To do that, you'll need the following on your machine:

1. git

Your machine will need git to be able to efficiently work with this code repository.
(Plus, git is awesome to try out as part of a developer's toolkit!)

[You can get the latest git version for your machine here](http://git-scm.com).

2. Node

This project uses Node so that you can run it (as a website) on most any computer,
not just a dedicated server. To be able to run the presentation, you'll need to install
Node on your machine.
