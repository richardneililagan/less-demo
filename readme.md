# less-demo

LESS demo is a web presentation deck touching on a very high level introduction
to CSS preprocessors (LESS and SASS). Samples in this presentation are written in *LESS*.

This presentation is written purely in web technologies (just HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript!),
and makes use of LESS CSS for presentation styles.

Animation and positioning styles are dynamically provided by the fantastic
[impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/) framework by [Bartek Szopka](https://github.com/bartaz).

* *SASS* http://sass-lang.com
